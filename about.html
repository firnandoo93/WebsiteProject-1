            <h1>ABOUT BAYMONSTER</h1>
            <p>
              BabyMonster (Korean: 베이비몬스터; RR: Beibimonseuteo; stylized in
              all caps), also known as Baemon (Korean: 베몬), is a South Korean
              girl group formed by YG Entertainment through the reality program
              Last Evaluation (2023). The group consists of seven members: Ruka,
              Pharita, Asa, Ahyeon, Rami, Rora, and Chiquita. They officially
              debuted on April 1, 2024, with their eponymous first extended play
              (EP) BabyMons7er.

            <h2>2018–2022: Formation and pre-debut activities</h2>
            <p>
              Following the launch of YG Entertainment's representative girl
              groups, 2NE1 (2009) and Blackpink (2016), news of their next girl
              group circulated as early as 2018. They received applicants from
              various countries, some of whom were accepted into its training
              program as early as age 10, training an average of four to five
              years. In the number of recruits, each prospective member placed
              first against thousands in their respective auditions. In January
              2020, "BabyMonster", one of many names initially considered for
              Blackpink, and "Baemon" (a syllabic abbreviation of the former)
              were trademarked in English and Korean by the label and
              tentatively used by media outlets until the eventual disclosure of
              their official uses. Its selection process was chronicled in Last
              Evaluation (2023), a reality show filmed in the previous year
              prior to its airing, showcasing seven potential members. Label
              founder, Yang Hyun-suk, enlisted assistance by Lee Su-hyun of
              AKMU, and Winner's Kang Seung-yoon and Lee Seung-hoon amidst
              others to judge, rank, and determine its formation for the
              duration of the show. Yang revealed the number of members he first
              planned was five; however, a seven-piece ensemble was finalized
              with three South Koreans (Ahyeon, Rami, Rora), two Japanese (Ruka,
              Asa), and two Thai members (Pharita, Chiquita). Ahyeon, Ruka,
              Chiquita, Rami, and Pharita were selected by the label, while Rora
              and Asa were contemplated to be placed into two different projects
              before ultimately joining the final line-up as the "fans' choice".
              Most held prior experience in the entertainment industry ahead of
              their acceptance into YG Entertainment. Rami began as a child
              model at age two ahead of her audition in 2018; Ruka debuted in
              the Japanese girl group Shibu3 project (2017) before she became
              the longest trained member of the seven; Rora joined the
              children's music group U.SSO Girl under the stage name U.ha with
              Hyein of NewJeans prior to her audition in May 2018; and Pharita
              modelled in contests and auditioned for survival reality programs
              until she was chosen out of 1,226 applicants amidst her audition
              in July 2020, becoming the sixth to be accepted. Asa and Ahyeon
              auditioned for the label in 2018 and December 2018, respectively.
              Chiquita became the final member to join BabyMonster, training for
              three months since her recruit in 2021, the shortest period of all
              members. During this time, the members' vocals were often
              recruited in the background of their senior labelmate's work,
              including in the final chorus of the lead single, "Iyah" (아이야;
              aiya) by Kang Seung-yoon.

            <h2>2023–present: Introduction and debut</h2>
            <p>
              YG Entertainment signaled the septet's formal introduction on
              December 30, 2022, with a poster and the subtext "YG Next
              Movement". It heralded a trailer-esque video posted on YouTube on
              New Year's Day that garnered 15 million views in three days, and
              featured appearances by members of Winner and Blackpink, sibling
              duo AKMU, dancer and choreographer Leejung Lee, and label founder
              Yang Hyun-suk. BabyMonster's introduction, together with the
              announcement of G-Dragon's feasible return as a soloist that same
              day, contributed to a subsequent rise in the label's stocks,
              leaping by 11.74%. The seven members were revealed to the public
              through gradual releases of live performance videos starting on
              January 12 (in order: Rami, Ahyeon, Chiquita, Asa, Rora, Pharita,
              and Ruka); and through the eventual pre-debut promotional single
              titled "Dream", released exclusively via YouTube on May 14, 2023,
              debuting atop the Billboard Hot Trending Songs chart. Their
              channel soon surpassed one million subscribers in 52 days since
              its creation on December 28, 2022, and two million subscribers in
              129 days, becoming the fastest K-pop girl group to reach the
              milestone. BabyMonster released two singles as a six-piece titled
              "Batter Up" and "Stuck in the Middle" on November 27, 2023, and
              February 1, 2024, respectively, with the former serving as the
              sextet's debut single and the septet's pre-debut release.
              Label-mates Lee Chan-hyuk of AKMU and Choi Hyun-suk of Treasure
              contributed in penning the former piece, while its member Asa,
              worked on both its music and lyrics. Its music video amassed 22.59
              million views within a day, became the most viewed debut music
              video in the first 24 hours in K-pop history, and became the
              fastest debut music video to reach 100 million views on the
              platform, eighteen days after its release. It found further
              success on Spotify, achieving 10 million streams in ten days, the
              fastest for a rookie K-pop girl group. Ahyeon, whom was absent
              from its releases due to health reasons, soon recovered and
              returned from her hiatus, joining the other members of BabyMonster
              to promote their future activities as a seven-member group.
              Marking the group's official debut, their first extended play
              BabyMons7er, was released on April 1, which included re-recordings
              of "Batter Up" and "Stuck in the Middle" with all seven members,
              and a song gifted by Charlie Puth. The extended play was primarily
              supported by the title track "Sheesh".
